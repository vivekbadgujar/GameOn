## 📋 Firebase Configuration

**Important:** The current Firebase config files are placeholders. For production:

2. Add your Android app with package name: `com.gameon.mobile`
3. Download the real `google-services.json` file
4. Replace the placeholder file in the mobile directory
5. Configure Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Messaging as needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Device not detected:** Run `.\check-device-connection.ps1`
2. **Build errors:** Check Android Studio and SDK installation
3. **App crashes:** Check Metro bundler logs for JavaScript errors
4. **Firebase issues:** Verify configuration files are correct
