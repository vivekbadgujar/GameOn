   - Added proper Socket.IO context integration
   - Implemented polling fallback mechanism (30s intervals)
   - Better error handling and connection status monitoring

3. **Debug Route Added**: Created `/api/admin/users/debug` endpoint for testing database connectivity without authentication

### ✅ **Fix 2: Tournament Join → Frontend Display**
**Problem**: After joining tournaments, "No Tournament Found" was displayed in "My Tournaments".

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Fixed Participant Matching**: Enhanced `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/TournamentSlots.js`
   - Comprehensive participant ID matching logic
   - Better handling of different data structures (ObjectId vs string)
   - Detailed logging for debugging participant matching

2. **Real-time Tournament Updates**: Added Socket.IO listeners for tournament join events
   - Listen for `tournamentJoined` events
   - Automatic refresh of tournament data on join
   - Better error handling and status updates

3. **Backend Join Logic Fix**: Fixed `backend/routes/tournaments.js`
   - Corrected participant duplicate checking logic
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Better error messages and status codes

### ✅ **Fix 3: Tournament Details Page Enhancement**
**Problem**: Tournament details not showing correctly after joining.

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Enhanced Participant Detection**: Fixed `frontend/src/pages/TournamentDetails.js`
   - Improved `isUserJoined()` function with comprehensive ID matching
   - Better handling of different participant data structures
   - Real-time updates via Socket.IO integration

2. **Real-time Updates**: Added Socket.IO listeners for tournament updates
   - Listen for tournament status changes
   - Automatic refresh on participant changes
   - Better user experience with instant updates

### ✅ **Fix 4: General Data Consistency**
**Problem**: Mixed hardcoded data and inconsistent API responses.

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Removed Hardcoded Data**: Updated dashboard to fetch real tournament data
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and logging throughout
3. **Rate Limiting Adjustment**: Temporarily disabled for development testing
4. **Socket.IO Event Enhancement**: Added `tournamentJoined` event to frontend Socket context

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Backend Changes:
- `backend/routes/auth.js`: Enhanced user registration Socket.IO events
- `backend/routes/tournaments.js`: Fixed participant matching and added logging
- `backend/routes/admin/users.js`: Added debug route for testing
- `backend/server.js`: Temporarily disabled rate limiting for development

### Frontend Changes:
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/TournamentSlots.js`: Enhanced participant filtering and real-time updates
- `frontend/src/pages/TournamentDetails.js`: Fixed participant detection and added real-time updates
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js`: Removed hardcoded tournament status filter
- `frontend/src/contexts/SocketContext.js`: Added `tournamentJoined` event listener

### Admin Panel Changes:
- `admin-panel/src/components/Users/UserManagement.js`: Enhanced real-time updates with Socket.IO and polling fallback

## 🧪 Testing Scripts Created

1. **`test-data-sync.js`**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing script
   - Tests complete flow: Signup → Admin Panel → Join Tournament → My Tournaments → Tournament Details
   - Automated testing with detailed reporting

2. **`quick-test.js`**: Quick diagnostic script
   - Tests backend health and database connectivity
   - Validates API endpoints
   - Provides troubleshooting recommendations

3. **`start-dev.ps1`**: Development environment startup script
   - Starts backend, frontend, and admin panel
   - Runs automated tests after startup
   - Provides service URLs and status

## 🚀 How to Test the Fixes

### Method 1: Automated Testing
```powershell
# Run the comprehensive test
node test-data-sync.js

# Or run quick diagnostics
node quick-test.js
```

### Method 2: Manual Testing
1. **Start all services**:
   ```powershell
   # Backend (Terminal 1)
   cd backend
   npm run dev

   # Frontend (Terminal 2)
   cd frontend
   npm start

   # Admin Panel (Terminal 3)
   cd admin-panel
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test the flow**:
   - Sign up a new user on frontend (http://localhost:3000)
   - Check if user appears in Admin Panel → Users (http://localhost:3001)
   - Create a tournament in Admin Panel
   - Join the tournament from frontend
   - Check "My Tournaments" section
   - View tournament details

### Method 3: Using PowerShell Script
```powershell
# Run the startup script (starts everything and runs tests)
.\start-dev.ps1
```

## 🔍 Debugging Information

### Check Backend Logs
Look for these log messages:
- `Emitting userRegistered event for: [username]`
- `Tournament join request: [details]`
- `Tournament found: [tournament info]`

### Check Frontend Console
Look for these messages:
- `TournamentSlots: Found match! [participant details]`
- `TournamentDetails: Processing tournamentJoined event`
- `UserManagement: New user registered via Socket.IO`

### Check Admin Panel Console
Look for these messages:
- `UserManagement: Setting up Socket.IO listeners`
- `Socket.IO connected: [socket id]`

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Users not appearing in Admin Panel
**Solution**: 
1. Check if Socket.IO is connected in admin panel console
2. Use debug route: `GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/users/debug`
3. Check if polling fallback is working (30s intervals)

### Issue: Tournament join fails with 400 error
**Solution**:
1. Check backend logs for specific error message
2. Verify user authentication token
3. Check tournament status and participant limits

### Issue: "My Tournaments" shows empty
**Solution**:
1. Check participant matching logic in browser console
2. Verify tournament join was successful
3. Check Socket.IO events for real-time updates

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **User Signup**: New users appear in Admin Panel within 30 seconds (real-time if Socket.IO connected)
2. **Tournament Join**: Successful join shows immediate feedback and updates "My Tournaments"
3. **Tournament Details**: Shows correct participant status and real-time updates
4. **Data Consistency**: All data comes from database, no hardcoded values

## 🔄 Real-time Features

- **User Registration**: Admin panel updates automatically
- **Tournament Join**: Participant count updates in real-time
- **Tournament Status**: Status changes propagate immediately
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Polling ensures updates even if Socket.IO fails

## 📝 Notes

- Rate limiting is temporarily disabled for development
- Debug routes are available for testing database connectivity
- Comprehensive logging added for easier debugging
- Socket.IO events enhanced for better real-time experience
